Climate Change: Analyzing Trends and Developing Sustainable Solutions
Project Overview:
  This project aims to analyze trends in climate change using data from NASA and the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). By processing historical climate data, we predict the future impact of climate change and develop sustainable solutions. The processed data will be uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket, and graphical visualizations will be created using Power BI.

Technologies Used:
  AWS (S3, Lambda, etc.)
  Power BI for visualizations
  Python for data processing
  Pandas for data manipulation
  Matplotlib / Seaborn for data visualization
  Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory analysis
  CSV data from NASA and IPCC
